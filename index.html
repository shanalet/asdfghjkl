        <a>Guilt and Killing Zombies <small>A Short Essay</small></a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
		<p>Within Haitian religion, a zombie is an animated corpse raised by magical means, usually witchcraft. In modern popular culture, they are usually depicted as decaying, unstable, and mindless reanimated corpses. It is very common today for zombies to have an unknown desire for consuming human flesh, more specifically, the brain. The concept of zombies has taken over most of pop culture and media. Numerous video games, movies, TV shows, and novels have already achieved critical acclaim and success by taking advantage of this newfound craze.
		</p><p>A typical concept in zombie media is the idea of a ‘zombie apocalypse’. A zombie apocalypse happens when an unknown disease that turns humans and corpses into zombies infects most of the modern civilization leaving the government, environment, economy and world infrastructure in ruins leaving only a handful of survivors. These survivors generally have to search for remaining supplies in the ruins of civilization and fend off zombies that attack them to keep themselves alive. In most, if not all, zombie-related media, the death of a zombie is present as well as the death of a zombie that was once a beloved character within the story. In the event of an actual zombie apocalypse, it is most likely that a person’s demise is being killed by a zombie. Therefore, to avoid that, a person will resort to killing a zombie.
		</p><p>When you start to think of what you’ve done to keep yourself alive, it is understandable why you might feel guilt. The zombie you just killed most probably had a life, a job, a spouse, children, dreams, aspirations and you ended its life. Ending a life will be the most regrettable thing you have done and you did it and will continue to do it as long as you live but you are not sure whether or not you should feel guilty because of the confusion between the zombie’s history and whether or not he or she was actually dead.
		</p><p>To try and answer this, we will use the universe of The Walking Dead by Robert Kirkman. In The Walking Dead, for unknown reasons, most, if not all, people on the planet contracted a pathogen that, for unknown reasons, reanimates a person’s corpse when said person has died. This pathogen provides information that a certain person has already died before officially turning into a zombie. It tells you that this person has already died no matter what the cause was. The person has lived his life before turning into a zombie because of the function of the pathogen. Therefore, the original consciousness that inhibited the body has already left and has been replaced by another, more dangerous consciousness.
		</p><p>To understand further, we will use the universe of The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z by Max Brooks. In The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z, a virus known as Solanum infects the world and causes a war. The war and the virus ended up killing off 70% of the world population. 	 Solanum can only be transmitted from one person to another via the contact of bodily fluids. Once Solanum is in the body, it attempts to reach the brain. When that occurs, all bodily activity ceases together with the destruction of the frontal lobe. The infected then loses his individuality and personality. Only minor brain activity is left as the virus mutates other cells. The brain activity is needed to keep the infected ‘alive’ to hunt and consume other humans.
		</p><p>In this situation, it is certain that any zombie seen is alive and not undead. However, it is very likely that he consciousness that once inhibited the body has disappeared and died when the virus infected the brain and started to control its body. If that is true, I would be happy to kill the virus that forcefully ripped him out of his/her body. If the original consciousness was still there and it is just trapped inside the body, I would still kill the zombie as form of mercy. If I were the one that was trapped inside the body and still was aware of what I was doing just not able to control, I would wish for death. It would be illogical and unlikely that if the original consciousness did not want to die if it was still trapped. Mostly because the infected would have to see his or herself consume and eat other people and they should know that there is no cure and therefore, no way to escape.
		</p><p>In both of these examples, as well as taking into account a host of other media relating to zombies, you should not feel guilty in killing zombies. In fact, you should mostly feel proud. The chances are you’re doing the person a huge favor. It is very likely that alive or dead, a person would not allow his body to be used for any despicable thing, especially consuming, infecting and killing another human being.
		</p><p>If there’s anyone that should feel guilty, it’s the virus.</p>

	<p>“Why? Are you going to seduce her to your side?”
	</p><p>“No reason, just for me to check if she exists which I highly doubt”
	</p><p>“Her name is Tessa Simmons. Now, shush. School Reunion is on.” He turns his attention completely to the screen.
	</p><p>I don’t argue after that. For the second time, I walk out and the close the door behind me. I placed my plate in the dishwasher and I head up to my room. With the large selection of games I have, it took me a while to choose a game but I finally settled with Mirror’s Edge. 
	</p><p><i>Wait, if Tess? Jess? Tessa? Yes, Tessa. If Tessa is close to my age and she’s from my school. Why don’t I know her?</i> I thought. Although he doesn’t have much popularity as me, Victor wouldn’t be caught dead with someone who looked bad much less given her a ride. So this girl must be quite a looker, maybe. Victor’s a sophomore and this Tessa is my age so there are about 300 students that could be her. Obviously, I wouldn’t know that many people. 
	</p><p><i>She must be some new exchange student. We get exchange students and transferees a lot. Even if the year was winding down,</i> I say to myself and her enigma is solved. Her name doesn’t cross my mind again that day. Or so I thought.
	</p><p>After about five hours, a half box of pizza (the other half eaten by Victor), 6 strips of bacon, a six-pack of Mountain Dew, 426 kills, 72 deaths, and a sextillion cookies later, it’s the middle of the afternoon. I look out my window to see that the weather is pretty nice. Noon is great for a run, which is exactly what my Saturday routine tells me to do.
	</p><p>Many people wonder why I don’t have a girlfriend so I have “better” things to do on the weekends. Or why don’t I have a girlfriend at all. I’m the only one in the whole school football team who doesn’t have a girlfriend. I’ve been told by a lot of my friends that I’m one of the most attractive in the team. <i>Come on, Danny. Who wouldn’t fall for that lemony hair and eyes bluer and more beautiful than the clearest sky,</i> she said. Sadly, I’m just as good as showing emotion as a brick wall. I don’t think I can commit to being in a relationship. Much less, fall for anyone again.
	</p><p>I change my cargo shorts for some nice simple running shorts, keeping my shirt. Some socks and a pair of running shoes go on my feet and I grab my phone. I scan my room for my earphones. Once located, I grab them and plug them into my phone. I turn up the music; shove the phone into my pocket and start running out of my room, down the hallway, down the stairs, through the gathering room, the front door, the porch and finally, the front yard. I probably should’ve closed the door to my room but it was too late.
	</p><p>Though our property provides for than enough leg room for me, I prefer running out of our neighborhood and seeing some familiar faces while I run along the sidewalk. I run past house after house, car after car, seeing happy, sad, angry, surprised and familiar faces. This is just another beautiful, normal Saturday. After about 45 minutes, I make my way home, with the music guiding me. By the time I arrive, the music stops. In its place: a ringtone.
	</p><p>I pull my phone out of my pocket to read the message. I don’t get a lot of messages. Only a handful of people know my private cell.
	</p><p><i>Hm, must be the wrong number.</i>

      <div class="panel-body">
	<p>I open my eyes to find myself sitting on a cheap plastic chair that has a white cloth covering on it, like something you’d find at a low-budget event like a wedding reception or graduation. Looking around, I realize I’m inside a metal cylinder, or at least, what looks like metal. I must’ve been kidnapped. But how could I? I just blinked or something and all of a sudden, I’m trapped. Where am I? How’d I get here? How is this possible?
	</p><p>I look up and there seems to be a white, glowing ring the size of a dinner plate whose light is slowly fading away. I kept staring at it until it lost all light when I realized it was levitating. There was nothing above it. It slowly rose up to the ceiling of the tube. The ceiling of my tube opened up when the ring was about to touch it, the ring didn’t stop rising up but then the ground started rising up as well.
	</p><p>As the ring rose higher, the floor of my tube rose up with it as if the ring was pulling it up with it. When the ring stopped, the floor did as well. This time, I’m inside a white tube. I stand up from my chair to see that it was actually plastic, or at least, what I think is plastic. I reach above me to try and touch the ring that currently just levitating there, as if it’s waiting for something. The moment I touch it, the light from the ring started up again. It grew brighter and brighter until it was blinding. The white walls of the tube weren’t helping, reflecting the white light onto itself and my body as the light grew brighter. I was forced to close my eyes.
	</p><p>When the light died down half a minute later, I looked up to see the ring is no longer glowing but is plated in what seems to look like gold. It was also starting to follow my head instead of staying fixated in the air.
	</p><p>“Hello? Is anyone there?” I called out, knocking on the tube as hard as I could. When the sentence left my mouth, a door shaped opening on one area of the tube slid open. When it did, I saw a stream of people walking towards the direction where green arrows on the floor were pointing at, all of them with a gold ring levitating above them. I stepped out of my tube and decided to go with the flow and follow the arrows as well. The hallway was what seemed like an endless row of the same white tubes next to each other, with people stepping out of them every minute or so.
	</p><p>Many of the people had confused looks on their faces. Some were mad, some were crying, and some were screaming. I decided to keep to myself until I found out what was going on. Some people were having conversations but most kept quiet like I did. I’m guessing they’re just as curious as I am.
	</p><p>The end of the endless hallway was an empty red-carpeted room with white walls, a double door, and a huge screen taking up most of the wall occupied by the double-door. The message displayed on the screen didn’t reflect the usefulness of it size as it only displayed a small message:
	</p><p><i>Everything you need to know will be shown to you in film. The doors will open in:</i>

	<p>The events described in this collection of stories has been the cause of debate by scholars for decades and the very reality of these events can never be confirmed nor denied due to the near-impossibility of time-travel.
	</p><p>In 2014, a class of 29 teenagers living in the vicinity of Greater Manila, Philippines were the epicenter of an unknown quantum phenomenon yet to be fully explained by historians and researchers. The full extent of this disaster was unknown as no physical or structual damage was ever observed. The victims of the catastrophe were also physically unharmed. However, they all claimed that novel universes created from the imaginations of this universe intersected in their room where space was expanded to accomodate the intruding universes. They also claimed that over 200 years have passed from their mental point of view, while only one hour has past relative to this universe.
	</p><p>Dismissed as a hoax, the victims were sent home where all of them suffered from mental breakdowns. All were sent to the hospital immediately where it was discovered that they were all suffering from severe mental health disorders and varying stages of skin cancer. Fearing all evidence could be lost, all were soon sent to a mental asylum where they would be treated until such time that all that happened within the walls of the classroom that day could be explained.
	</p><p>One month later, the victims recovered enough to form complete thoughts and sentences. They were all extensively interviewed independent from one another.
	</p><p>This event caused by the unknown phenomenon and the months following it was soon renamed the Roentgen Catastrophe after the name of the class which was named after German physicist, Wilhelm Roentgen.

        Parenting Licensure <small>An Opinion Piece Excerpt</small></a>
      </h4>

    <div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
	<p>In order to do important or big things like going out with your friends, making a big purchase, or doing something new, you need permission to do so. As teenagers, you get permission from your parents or your teachers. As you grow older, eventually you’ll want to do bigger things like fishing, building, hunting, or making a business. And you need to ask permission for those as well, except you have the get it from the government.
	</p><p>And that’s what licensure is. It’s basically the government giving you permission to do certain things. And some of these things are important like driving a car, carrying a firearm, teaching, and giving medical advice and prescriptions. You need permission from the government to do these things because you could potentially harm someone else whether physically or mentally.
	</p><p>But why doesn’t this apply to having a child? Keanu Reeves in the movie Parenthood said, "You know, Mrs. Buckman, you need a license to buy a dog, to drive a car - hell, you even need a license to catch a fish. But they'll let any butt-reaming asshole be a father." Think about it, two people are jointly responsible for raising, nurturing, and teaching a child to be a stable, normal human being for decades, that’s a massive responsibility. And yet, anyone can do it. So why not implement a parenting license? If you aren’t capable of taking care of a child and raising it properly, you shall not be permitted to have said child.	
	</p><p>Sounds like a good idea, yeah? We’ve got a ton of problems with regards to overpopulation, child abuse, depression, suicide, and domestic violence. If there are fewer children and fewer bad parents, these problems will slowly go away; simple as that. So let’s do it.
	</p><p>Let’s say the government decides that the problems involving bad parenting and bad children have grown too big to ignore: it’s time to call in Congress and they get into talks. Well, the first thing they’ll talk about is requirements. What are the requirements of being a good parent? What do you have to do? What do you need?

      <div class="panel-body">
	<p>Hello there, my friend.
	<br>Or, at least, that's what you want me to believe
	<br>But I can't believe it any longer
	<br>And as more days go by
	<br>The more this friendship seems like a lie</p>

	<p>I know I lied to you, my friend.
	<br>I have lied about a great many things
	<br>So much that I had to tell you the truth
	<br>Because the voices in my head told me to
	<br>Then everything started to fall</p>

	<p>I thought I had ruined it all, my friend
	<br>I thought our tower based on friendship fell
	<br>So I asked you of its condition
	<br>You told me it was upright yet damaged
	<br>Without showing my proof nor debris</p>

	<p>I wanted to go away that day, my friend
	<br>I wanted to end it all to spare you the burden
	<br>Of my presence
	<br>I told you what I felt
	<br>And you protested and told me you cared
	<br>So I stayed because I believed you</p>

	<p>You've changed a lot, my friend
	<br>It's been a long time since you've spent your time
	<br>Talking to someone as useless as me
	<br>I have become a ghost in your eyes
	<br>Always present
	<br>Never acknowledged</p>

	<p>Very rarely do I see you smile around me anymore, my friend
	<br>Very rarely do I feel your care
	<br>Even if you said you cared, very much
	<br>Our tower based on friendship has fallen
	<br>And you want to keep it that way
	<br>Because it is not worth rebuilding</p>

	<p>Instead of care, I see tolerance
	<br>Instead of happiness, I see irritation
	<br>Instead of company, I only see presence
	<br>I may have lied to you
	<br>But I have told you the truth
	<br>Because I trust you and hope that you will understand</p>

	<p>I want to leave
	<br>Everybody wants me to leave
	<br>So please do not lie to me
	<br>Especially not to the following question:
	<br>Do you want me to leave too?</p>

			<h3>Music
			</h3>

			<h3>Genres
			</h3>
			<p>Science fiction and historical fiction appeal to me the most. I do, however, have a soft spot for mystery and maybe romance if it has well-established themes from the aforementioned genres.</p>

			<p>I'm paradoxically introverted and extroverted. On all cases though, I am a people-pleaser and I'm able to carry a conversation on almost any start point on almost any topic.</p>
